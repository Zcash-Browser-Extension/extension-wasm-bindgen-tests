# How to run a developer / local extension on Chrome
* Open extension menu (the puzzle piece icon to the right of address bar)
* Choose "Manage extensions"
* Choose "Load unpacked"
* Navigate to extension directory and pick "Select"
* Extension will appear in listing of extensions and is ready to use
* Remember you need to reload the extension (the circle arrow icon) after and code changes
